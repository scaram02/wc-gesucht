# WC-Gesucht

## The Name

WC Gesucht is a German phrase translated roughly as "Seeking Restroom." It is based on a popular apartment-searching website called "WG Gesucht."

## The Story

In Fall 2019, a partner and I developed a project at Ironhack Berlin in which users could map out restrooms. The purpose was twofold: first, to help users find restrooms that created a positive experience, and second, to help users find cheaper locations. With money saved at a cheaper restroom, a user could donate to an organization that builds sanitation facilities in places that don't have access to them. Since our project was a demo app, we did not end up including the actual functionalities to donate.

The app we created had some issues with the login checks and was not fully mobile responsive.

Finding myself with more free time a year later, I decided to reuse the idea of mapping restrooms and make it my own, this time using React.js in the frontend. I also improved the backend models and changed many overall functionalities to make it my own. Now, although the idea is the same, the code is very different from a year ago. This time around, I have left the payment form out completely, as I am not connected to any relevent organization, but if you are reading this, please consider donating somewhere anyway!

This was a simple app created for React practice and something to do.

## To run this app:

Fork or clone this, then run: 

`npm run dev` in the root and `npm start` in client/src
